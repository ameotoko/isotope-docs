Isotope eCommerce offers a wide range of configuration options. Many settings are related to or dependent on others. It is therefore advisable to follow a certain editing sequence to minimize the effort.

Basically, you always start at the bottom right and work your way up. Later you will almost only need the upper settings, which is why we decided on this order.

The only exceptions to this are the [translations](/de/backend-konfiguration-shop-verschiedenes-%C3%9Cbersetzungen/) and the[integrity check](/de/backend-konfiguration-shop-verschiedenes-Integrit%C3%A4tscheck/), which you will of course only need anyway if you run multilingual shops or want to perform an integrity check for your installation. This configuration item is therefore always at the bottom.

Pictorially represented results in the following order:

You will notice that the navigation in this guide is based on the four legends (the green separators) and then the corresponding configuration items. Consequently, it continues as follows:
