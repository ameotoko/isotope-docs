The payment type "Cash" is an "offline" payment type. This payment type therefore does not automate payments and can therefore be used for the following use cases:

- Payment on account
- Payment in cash on collection
- Payment in advance
- etc.

## Payment type-specific configuration

Since no automatic payment is made for this payment type, there are no further configuration options apart from the[general settings](/de/backend-konfiguration-shop-bestellablauf-zahlungsarten/).
