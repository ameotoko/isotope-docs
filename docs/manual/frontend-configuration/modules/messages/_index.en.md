The module `Messages` displays all messages from Isotope eCommerce. Examples of such messages would be:

- The selected product has been added to the shopping cart.
- The minimum order quantity for "~product~" is ~number~ of pieces. Please check your shopping cart.
- The unordered products from your last visit have been added back. Please check the contents of your shopping cart.

This makes it possible to output the messages in the header area of the website, for example, and not in the content area, where the other modules such as [product list](/de/frontend-konfiguration-module-produktliste/), etc. are usually located and output the messages.
