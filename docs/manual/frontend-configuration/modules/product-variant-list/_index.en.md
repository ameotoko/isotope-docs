The module `Produktvarianten-Liste` is responsible for the output of product variants. It is basically a child module of the [product list](/de/frontend-konfiguration-module-produktliste/) and behaves identically, with the only exception that the list outputs each individual variant of the products and not just the product itself.

Since the configuration settings are the same as those of the product list, they are not documented again here.
