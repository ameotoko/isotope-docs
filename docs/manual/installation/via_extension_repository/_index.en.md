Isotope eCommerce can be easily installed via the extension repository, just like many other Contao extensions. The easiest way to do so starts with a click on `Erweiterungsverwaltung` in the backend.

On a fresh Contao installation it looks like this:

Click on `Erweiterung installieren` in the upper right corner.

The next screen allows you to enter the desired extension. Here you type `isotope`, make sure the spelling is correct and that Isotope eCommerce is compatible with your Contao version:

After clicking `Weiter`, you can select the desired version. You should never use beta versions for production use. So watch out for the keyword `stable` and try to stay up to date with the help of the [official blog](http://isotopeecommerce.org/de/blog.html). Here you can install the version `2.0.3 stable`:

Follow the further steps and perform the database update. If the installation was successful, you should now see the new navigation points:

You can check if the correct version of Isotope eCommerce has been installed by clicking `Shop-Konfiguration`. The installed version of Isotope eCommerce is displayed in the title:

That's all. Now you can start [configuring your webshop](/de/backend/).
